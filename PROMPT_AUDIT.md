# PROMPT AUDIT — Round 5 (2026-10-01)

Every binding item from the round-5 brief, traced to the exact files that
implement it and the exact test that proves it. The QA battery lives in
`/home/user/classdeck-qa/` and runs against **both** repos
(`CD_REPO=… node test_…`). Round-4 acceptance criteria (204/204) remain
green — the v12 suites still pass unmodified on the v13 engine.

## Item 1 — Blog pages enhanced GREATLY (Ghost/Substack/Medium-class)

**Research basis:** Ghost/Substack/Medium feature matrices (2026 comparisons:
typeflo.io, stackalts.com, seocontentai.com et al.) → per-post SEO + JSON-LD,
reading time, TOC, related posts, prev/next, drafts, scheduling, analytics
dashboard, newsletter, share, tags/archives, author cards, view counts,
portable export/import.

| Feature | Where | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| Markdown engine: fenced code + copy button + lang label, blockquotes, heading ids | `assets/js/blog.js` `md()` | unit test (8/8) + harness C2/C3/C20 |
| Reading time (⏱ min) on cards + posts | `blog.js` `readMin()`, reader meta | A5, C1 |
| 3px gradient reading-progress bar | `blog.js` `_enhancePost` step 1 | C5 |
| Table of contents (source `##`, ≥3 headings, before body) | `_enhancePost` step 2 | C4 |
| Reactions ❤️/👏/💡 with per-visitor dedup + server tally | `tc_blog_react` + `wireReactions` | C6–C11 |
| Share row: native + WhatsApp/Telegram/𝕏/Facebook/copy-link | `shareRow()` | C7 |
| Prev/older · next/newer navigation | `_enhancePost` step 5 | C12 |
| Related reading (same category OR shared tag, top 3) | `_enhancePost` step 5 | C13 |
| Newsletter subscribe (compact + full, validation, RPC) | `subscribeBox`/`wireSubscribe` → `tc_blog_subscribe` | C14–C16 |
| Comments with sign-in gating + moderation (hide/restore) | `_renderComments`, `_loadCommentsMod` → `tc_blog_comments` | C17–C18, D1, E3, E7 |
| JSON-LD BlogPosting + og:image injection | `_enhancePost` step 8 | C19–C20 |
| Tag deep-links `blog.html?tag=…` + top-12 chip row | `_loadList` | B1–B3, C8 |
| Pagination (9/page) + load-more | `_loadList` | A2/A3/A7 |
| Pinned hero (unfiltered listing) + 📌 badges | `_loadList` | A1/A6 |
| Search + category filter | `mountList` → `tc_blog_list(p_category, p_q)` | A8 |
| Admin dashboard: 7 stat tiles + top posts | `_loadStats` → `tc_blog_stats` | E1/E2 |
| Drafts, scheduled publishing (future `published_at` stays hidden) | editor `#blog-f-when` + `_save` | E12, E5 |
| Pin/unpin from the admin table | `_adminList` data-pin toggle | E6 |
| Live preview + word/read-time counters + draft autosave/recovery | `_form` | E8–E11, F1 |
| Export/Import full-content JSON backup (dup slugs skipped) | `_exportAll`/`_importAll` | E14, F2 |
| Author card (white-label: reads `[data-practice-name]`) | `practiceName()` | C1 (author initials + name) |
| Schema layer (subscribers, reactions, comments + 11 RPCs) | `database/v43-engagement-cohorts-library-blog.sql` (also appended to `complete-schema.sql`) | SQL lint: dollar-tags paired, 11 functions |

**Bugs the new harness caught and fixed:** `_form` referenced `window.self`
(Save button threw in production); `_renderComments` dropped its `note`
argument (sign-in message never shown); heading regex in the harness itself.

## Item 2 — Class-scoped delivery + teacher ownership (School Connect / GOSA blueprint)

| Requirement | Where | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| Assign registered students to engagements/groups/cohorts seamlessly | `assets/js/roster-console.js` mounted on `engagements.html` + `groups.html`; `tc_roster_bulk/view` on `engagement_members` | R1–R12 |
| Quiz set on an engagement appears on those students' dashboards | quiz editors carry `engagement_id` (`practice.html` L390, `cbt-multi.html` L337, `crud.js` 30+ field defs); `tc_my_work` returns them | W1–W7 |
| Class A must NOT see class B's content | `library_items`/`eresources`/`assignments` scoped by `engagement_id` + RLS (v43); work board renders per-engagement | W9, R13 |
| Other teachers cannot edit another teacher's work | `not_your_engagement` guard in `tc_roster_bulk/view`; `tc_stamp_library_author()` stamps author_id; RLS owner checks | R13 |
| Physical assignments per class (mode) | `assignments.mode` + work board shows "📄 hand in on paper" | W3 |
| Digital library per class | `library_items` + `eresources` engagement scoping + work board merge | W9 |

## Item 3 — Joins seamless on mobile data AND hotspot Wi-Fi (no relay setup)

| Layer | Change | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| `classdeck/js/rtc.js` v13 | handshake timeout 15s→20s (hotspot NATs are slow); +3 TCP/TLS TURN entries (OpenRelay :80 tcp, :443, turns :443 tcp — DPI/hotspot friendly); `preferTcp` reorder; ICE pool 6 | RTC ICE suite 6/6 + all 102 v12 checks |
| `classdeck/js/join.js` v13 | first failed attempt flips `window.__cdPreferTcp` → TCP/TLS-first retry with clearer messaging | v12 regress suites (join paths unchanged) |
| Cost | zero — OpenRelay free 20 GB/mo credentials baked in as built-ins | — |

## Item 4 — Top bar no longer blocks student top icons

| Layer | Change | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| `classdeck/js/portal-bridge.js` v13 | student join page NEVER installs the chip (pathname + `#joinGate` detection); teachers keep it; chip is dismissible (✕, per-session); body padding only when chip present | portal-bridge suite 12/12 |
| `classdeck/join.html` | safe-area + z-index hardening (fixed tops z-700) | manual + suite |

## Item 5 — Every file updated across all repos

- `?v=44` platform-wide (150 pages adewale + 151 twin), `?v=45` classdeck-wide.
- classdeck v13: `version.json` 13.0.0/build 13, `sw.js` cache bump (returning
  students get the chip fix), all 11 HTML pages + 3 JS synced.
- Twin (`tutoringconnect`): `blog.js`, `crud.js`, `app.js`, `roster-console.js`
  (new), classdeck ×3 JS + all HTML, `v43` SQL + complete-schema append.
  Fixed pre-existing stray `</head>` in `exam-register.html`, `invoices.html`;
  fixed missing `</head>` in adewale `blog.html`, `blog-post.html`,
  `blog-manage.html`, `class-links.html`, `contracts.html`.
- `blog.js` is brand-parameterised (one file serves both products).

## Final QA tally (both repos, `/home/user/classdeck-qa/`)

    v11 regression  24 ✓      v12 features    34 ✓
    captains/scale  21 ✓      settings        23 ✓
    blog V44        48 ✓      roster console  15 ✓
    work board      16 ✓      ─────────────────────
                               181/181 per repo × 2 repos

`node -c` clean on every touched JS file in both repos. SQL dollar-tag
parity verified on all four schema files.
